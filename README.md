# Large-Scale-CTR-XGBoost
Large-scale CTR prediction pipeline processing ~400M rows (100GB) of Criteo data. Implemented incremental learning using XGBoost and TensorFlow to optimize memory usage. Achieved 73.8% accuracy and 0.70 ROC-AUC using histogram-based gradient boosting and deep neural networks on high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
